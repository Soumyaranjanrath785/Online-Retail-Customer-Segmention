# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmention


Before going into the definition of customer segmentation, let us take a look at how online retail works and how the associated data would look like. When a person goes into a retail store and purchases a few items, the following basic data points should be generated:

• Customer Name/Customer ID

• Address/Contact number of the customer (Demographic information)

• Invoice number

• Product name and product code

• Quantity

• Unit Price

• Date and time of the transaction

• Coupon Code (if applicable)

• Discount amount (if applicable)

Now that we have developed a basic idea about how retail data looks like, let us think about how a company should think in order to make effective marketing policies.

One axiom frequently used in business and economics is the Pareto principle. This can be applied to understanding the revenue stream of a company as well.

***As per the Pareto Principle, 80% of outcomes result from 20% of all the causes of any given event.***

In business terms, we can say that 20% of customers contribute 80% share of the total revenue of a company. That’s why finding this set of people is important.

### **Understanding Customer Segmentation**

• Customer segmentation is the process of separating a company's customers into groups based on their shared characteristics. The purpose of customer segmentation is to determine how to relate to customers in each category in order to optimize each customer's value to the company. 

• Customer segmentation has the ability to help marketers reach out to each customer in the most efficient way possible. A customer segmentation study uses the huge quantity of data available on customers (and future customers) to identify distinct groups of consumers with a high degree of accuracy based on demographic, behavioural, and other characteristics.

• Insights from customer segmentation are used to develop tailor-made marketing campaigns and for designing overall marketing strategy and planning.

• To conclude, we saw how we can segment our customer depending on our business requirements. You can perform RFM for your entire customer base, or just a subset. For example, you may first segment customers based on a geographical area or other demographics, and then by RFM for historical, transaction-based behaviour segments.

• RFM analysis can help in answering many questions with respect to their customers and this can help companies to make marketing strategies for their customers, retaining their slipping customers and providing recommendations to their customer based on their interest. We used the K-means algorithm to segment our customer in various clusters having similar similarity. I think K-means did a pretty good job here.
